    What is an Algorithm?
    An algrorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

    Almost everything you do in programminginvolves some kind of algorithm

    How do you improve?
        1. Devise a plan for solving problems
        2. Master common problem solving patterns

    Problem Solving
    1. Understand the problem
    2. Explore concrete examples
    3. Break it down
    4. Solve/Simplify
    5. Look Back and Refactor


    1. Understanding the Problem:
        * Can i restate the problem in my own words? - simplify the problem into something you can relate to or understand
        * What are the inputs that go ino the problem? - know the data types, input size e.t.c
        * What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? - what should be the output
        * Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In order words,
          do i have aenough information to solve the problem? - check for constraints or lack of sufficient information to solve the problem
        * How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

    2. Explore concrete examples
        *Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
        *Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works the way it's supposed to

        -----
        *Start with small examples
        *Progress to more complex examples
        *Explore examples with empty inputs
        *Explore examples with Invalid inputs

    3. Break it down:
        *Explicitly write out the steps you want to take and communicate with the interviewer or colleague
        *These steps can be written as comments in your code explaining the step by step process you will take in solving the problem

    4. Solve or Simplify:
        If you can't solve the problem, then simplify the problem and solve it the way you can
        Then you can incoperate the difficulty back in the solution if you can
        * Simplify and write something and you can also ask questions when stuck but make sure you're on a right part

    5. Look back and Refactor
