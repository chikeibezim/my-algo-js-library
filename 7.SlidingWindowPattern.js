/*
    SLIDING WINDOW PATTERN
    This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or
    number from one posiiton to another.
    Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and
    a new window is created)

    Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string e.t.c

    An Example:
    Write a funnction called maxSubarraySum which accepts an arrau of integers and a 
    numver called n. the function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive
    elements in te array.
