//MASTER COMMON PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS
//patterns are like blueprints to solving a problem
/*
    Some Patterns:
    i. Frequency Counter Patterns
        - The idea is we use an object to basically collect a bunch of values and their frequencies
        - It avoids the need for nested loops which usually results onin O(n^2)
        - Used when comparing two values and the frequency of each value matters
        Example:
        Wtite a function same, which acepts two arays. The function should return true
        if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second
        array. The frequency of values must be the same.
 */

    //the function will take in two arrays
    
    function same(arr1, arr2){
        

    }

    same([2,5,5],[4,25,25])
